Traditional graphics rendering system are based on DX11 API or OpenGL API which could render vivid visual objects onto compute screens;

In this project, instead of original approach, we are using opencl for geometry computation, including rasterization, depth compute, some lighting calculations;

With the help of this technology, it will accelerate the computation process and final decrease the computation time for geometry calculation;
